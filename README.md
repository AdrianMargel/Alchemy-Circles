I wrote this code as a highschool student in 2017 as a fun experiment. The program uses recursion to generate alchemy circles. Each alchemy circle is made up of a set of smaller alchemy circles. A recursive method is called to rotate each child circle causing it to animate in an interesting looking way.

The first few lines of setup() can be changed to easily modify the settings of the program. Size() for the size of the window, spell count for the number of spells to be drawn and complexity for the detail each alc circle will generate with to.
